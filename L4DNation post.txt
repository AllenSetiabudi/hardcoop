A while back when L4D2 world champions NV made MikanPenguin's Hard12 config infamous, I was one of the disappointed to find the coop gamemode was not public and region locked to parts of Asia. 

The past few months however, I have been developing my own version, learning Sourcepawn along the way. I have written plugins to simulate a confogl versus game in coop. I have also written some plugins to improve the AI special infected's movement patterns, making them harder to kill without resorting to any wacky DLR style modifications.
Now that I feel I have done almost as much as I can for the config, I am sharing it here for others to enjoy and in the hope that others may decide to contribute to improving the config. I am looking forward to suggestions for improvement. I would like to acknowledge the Confogl team for all of their plugins I have included in their package. Thanks to High Cookie, Manu and KFC (you know who you are) for their contributions to creating/testing my new plugins. Thanks to PenPen for providing inspiration in his HardAlways configs. Also, I kindly request that you let me know if you are intending to use any of my plugins in your own configs.
You can find installation instructions and detailed information on the config here: github.com/breezyplease/hard12

This project has shifted from being a simple modification of the Hard 8 mutation into a separate config that relies totally on plugins, without needing any vscripts. I have left the old vscripts in the github but they are not needed. The config is ProMod based, without tank slowdown.

- promod based + scout + static scoremod
- fully configurable
- hard limit on max specials configuration
- tank support percent
