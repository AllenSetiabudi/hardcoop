# KNOWN ISSUES

##Known but accepted features  
> tank sometimes spawns close to/on survivors (because z_safe_spawn_range 0 is being used to allow SI to spawn closer)  
> changing campaigns early will cause bonus score to carryover to new campaign; requires a plugin reload of the static_scoremod  
> panic hordes occasionally do not spawn; may be due to the custom vscript overriding map specific panic vscripts

##Bugs     
> sometimes chargers do not deal damage 
> witch_and_tankifier.smx not working in coop mode
> occasionally saferoom weapon spawns do not appear or starting pistol is not given
> need a bonus reset command
> need an mvp printout at the end of a coop round
