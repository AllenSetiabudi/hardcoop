# KNOWN ISSUES

##Known but accepted features  
> tank sometimes spawns close to/on survivors (because z_safe_spawn_range 0 is being used to allow SI to spawn closer)  
> changing campaigns early will cause bonus score to carryover to new campaign; requires a plugin reload of the static_scoremod  
> panic hordes occasionally do not spawn; may be due to the custom vscript overriding map specific panic vscripts

##Bugs     
> sometimes chargers do not deal damage
