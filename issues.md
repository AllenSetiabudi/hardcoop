 * weapon(s) not spawning in saferoom  
 
>##Major Bugs

There are a few difficult to replicate, unsolved bugs to which workarounds have been applied 
 * sometimes SI do not deal damage: 
   * **autowipe.smx** wipes the team after 7 seconds if the whole team is pinned/incapacitated
 * respawning dead
   * **!respawn** to be readded as a survivor to the team
 * respawning out of saferoom
   * **!return** to be teleported to the starting safe area (does not working after any survivor has left saferoom)
