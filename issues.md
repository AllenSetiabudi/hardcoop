# KNOWN ISSUES

##Known but accepted features  
> tank sometimes spawns close to/on survivors (because z_safe_spawn_range 0 is being used to allow SI to spawn closer)  
> using admin privileges to force a campaign change will cause bonus score to carryover to new campaign  

##Bugs     
> sometimes survivors do not take damage  
> sometimes survivors stay dead after wipes  
> sometimes a cooldown period is skipped in the stage cycle, causing a 24 SI hit
