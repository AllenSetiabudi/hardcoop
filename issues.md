# KNOWN ISSUES

##Bugs   
> if multiple survivors are pinned, sometimes one of them will not take damage
> in starting saferoom, players loading in late or toggling IDLE will cause team mates will fire the inventory reset function (in versus_like_coop.smx)
> sometimes survivors stay dead after wipes
> tank sometimes spawns close to/on survivors (because z_safe_spawn_range 0 is being used to allow SI to spawn closer)
> using admin privileges to force a campaign change will cause bonus score to carryover to new campaign
