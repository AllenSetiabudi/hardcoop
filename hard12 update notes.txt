ai_targeting.smx & special_infected_wave_spawner.smx & coopbosses.smx
- reduced fake client usage to cut down on lag

 ai_aggressivespecials.smx
- removed for now (potentially causes issues with spawning)

ai_hunterpouncing
- hunters more likely to path for LOS than start pouncing (hunter_pounce_ready_range reduced from 1000 to 500)

coopbosses
- fixed broken tank spawns (creating a fake client to spawn tank was unnecessary)

special_infected_wave_spawner.smx
- limit changes carry over maps
- killing si before the whole hit spawns will no longer cause extra si to spawn in compensation
- default wave interval increased from 30 to 40 seconds (special_infected_wave_spawner.smx)		

Folder reorganisation
- moved config specific plugins to a 'hardcoop' folder

In The Hood config
- due to popular demand, a hunters only config
